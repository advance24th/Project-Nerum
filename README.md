### Project Nerum [Version 1]
Nerum is a restyled version of cathook, so you can basically call it __fancy cathook__ :P. <br>
Cathook is a linux required cheat, that cannot at all work on windows. [View Cathook](https://github.com/nullworks/cathook)
<br>

Cathook Is Under The MIT Licences, And We Understand we are most likely breaking a few terms there, but we are physically doing this as a design makeover,. no **names, watermarks, or // cooding** will be messed with.

Version Branches Can Change Due to Cathooks rapidlly updating and messing with the menu. so feel free to report us something thats gone afaired, and we'll fix it.

### Task's That Need To Be Finished Now
- [ ] Get The Menu Mostly Arranged
- [ ] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [ ] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
