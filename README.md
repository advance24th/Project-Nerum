### Project Nerum [Version 1]
Nerum is a restyled version of cathook, so you can basically call it __fancy cathook__ :P. <br>
Cathook is a linux required cheat, that cannot at all work on windows. [View Cathook](https://github.com/nullworks/cathook)
<br>

Cathook Is Under The MIT Licences, And We Understand we are most likely breaking a few terms there, but we are physically doing this as a design makeover. <br>
no **names, watermarks, or // cooding** will be messed with.
